## Project Description

Last Breath is a game is about escaping your spaceship after a predatory alien has boarded your space craft and has killed every person who once called this ship home. 
Your mission is to navigate through the now destroyed ship with your minimal oxygen depleting with every step and an unfinished map. But be cautious because 
if you run out of oxygen before you get to the escape pods, the alien will achieve its final kill.
